# Golf Cart LED Controller

Code to be run on an Olimex ESP 32 Gateway for driving WS2812 LED strips on my golf cart.

This code base was originally started on an older Arduino project and started with sample patterns from there.  Since then, additional patterns have been added which are specific to the layout of the LED strips on my cart.  It was also ported to the ESP32.

Future work:
- Use submodule instead of copy of FastLED
- More configurability
- Finish conversion to C++ (cleaner code, easier to maintain)
- Code cleanup
